- 👋 Hi, I’m @ken-i<br/><br/>
My real name is Ken, but okay - it was already taken.

- 👀 I’m interested in software - mainly open source, and use it when ever possible in building applications.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning the Debian build and release processes.

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Debian projects, and already work in the Debian Perl Group.

- 📫 How to reach me is simple - an email to keni@computer.org
